description: All lists componets

import { ComponentDemo } from "@components/InstallationDocs";
import { ComponentSourceTabs } from "@components/InstallationDocs";

<ComponentDemo demo={props.demo} />

## Installation

You can reuse components from this library by copying them to your project.
Its recommended to copy source code into folder aliased with **'@mailingui/components'**
For **BulletList** suppport you have to copy that one too.

<ComponentSourceTabs
  sources={props.componentsSource}
  order={["List", "BulletList"]}
/>

Common BulletList depends on Paragpraph component, so you have to copy that one too.

<ComponentSourceTabs sources={props.dependenciesSource} />
